# üçé Finite

**Finite** is a simple web app that lets you select and install multiple popular macOS applications at once, hassle-free. It generates a custom installer script that uses [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to automatically download and install your chosen apps.

## Features

- **One-click multi-app installer:** Select your favorite apps and generate a single script to install them all.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, easy-to-use interface with categories for productivity, development, browsers, media, games, and more.
- **Homebrew-powered:** Uses Homebrew Cask to install the latest versions of macOS apps.
- **No account or download required:** Everything runs in your browser.

## How It Works

1. **Select Apps:** Browse the categories and check the apps you want.
2. **Get Installer:** Click the "Get Installer" button to download a custom `finite.sh` script.
3. **Run Script:** Open Terminal, navigate to your Downloads folder, and run:

    ```sh
    sh ./finite.sh
    ```

   The script will install Homebrew if needed, then install all your selected apps.
